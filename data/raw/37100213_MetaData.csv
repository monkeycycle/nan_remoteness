1,"All counts are randomly rounded to a multiple of 3 using the following procedure: counts that are already a multiple of 3 are not adjusted; counts 1 greater than a multiple of 3 are adjusted to the next lowest multiple of 3 with a probability of two-thirds and to the next highest multiple of 3 with a probability of one-third. The probabilities are reversed for counts that are 1 less than a multiple of 3."
2,"The data are subject to revision."
3,"Counts represent the number of students enrolled in programs at the beginning of the school year (in September or as close as possible thereafter)."
4,"Totals may not add up to the sum of all categories due to rounding."
5,"Data are reported for off-reserve public schools. In the Elementary-Secondary Education Survey, public elementary and secondary schools are publicly funded schools that are operated by school boards or the province/territory."
6,"The Canada totals reflect data from the reporting provinces and territories."
7,"The totals reported in "Total, Indigenous identity" may not equal the sum of the four other categories. When more than one Indigenous identity was reported, the student was counted in each appropriate group, but only once in the totals."
8,""Indigenous identity" refers to the three Indigenous groups recognized by the Canadian Constitution: First Nations (North American Indian), Métis, and Inuit (Inuk). First Nations (North American Indian) includes both Status and Non-Status Indians."
9,""Indigenous, group not reported" includes instances where a student was reported as Indigenous but a group was not specified."
10,"“Grade not reported” includes instances where a student is not considered to be in a specific grade or where the student’s grade is not known."
